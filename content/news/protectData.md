title: Protecting Your Data
---

On September 6th, we will be hosting a short one-hour seminar focused on some general strategies for protecting your research data against hard drive failure, structure fires, natural disasters, and other calamities. If you've ever worried about what would happen to your work if this happened at your home or in your office but aren't sure how to back your data up effectively, this seminar is for you! We'll introduce some basic strategies and have plenty of time for Q & A. There will be a representative from SLU's Institutional Review Board to answer questions specific to human subjects data.

**Where: 3600 Morrissey Hall**

**When: Wednesday, September 6th from 2pm to 3pm**
