We are a collaborative, interdisciplinary group at [Saint Louis University](https://www.slu.edu) focused on building community around open source software and open science.

We host a [seminar series](/seminars) focused on the programming language `R` each semester. We also provide a forum for [brownbag](/brownbags) sessions where SLU faculty, staff, and students can share open source data anlysis skills. More details about our projects are available on our [About page](/about).

The DSS is organized by [Christina Garcia](mailto:christina.garcia@slu.edu), [Kelly Lovejoy](mailto:kelly.lovejoy@slu.edu), and [Chris Prener](mailto:chris.prener@slu.edu).
