We are a collaborative, interdisciplinary group at [Saint Louis University](https://www.slu.edu) focused on building community around open source software and open science. Our goal is to bring faculty, students, and staff together from around the University in a way that bridges traditional barriers to collaboration and learning within colleges and University. We are also dedicated to creating a welcoming, inclusive data science community here at SLU (see the 'Inclusion and our Code of Conduct' section below).

We organize the following efforts:

1. We run [seminars](/seminars) each semester - four 1 hour lessons on a specific topic. We currently have a rotation of six seminars that we are beginning again in Fall 2018, and all of our materials are available through [GitHub](http://github.com/slu-dss).
2. We run an annual [ATLAS Week session](http://github.com/slu-dss/atlasWeek) that aims to provide participants with a brief introduction to `R` and the `tidyverse`.
3. We have at least one [brownbag seminar](/brownbags) per semester focused on using open source and/or open science techniques.
4. Beginning in the Fall of 2018, we’ll be hosting campus-wide meet ups for the open source data science community here at SLU. We have tentative plans for two meet ups during the 2018-19 academic year. We’re hoping to identify sources of funding to make these happen regularly passed next year.
5. We are building a database of classes taught here at SLU that use open source software to help students and faculty identify the best opportunities to expand their skills. This will be available beginning Fall 2018.
6. We host the [openGIS](http://github.com/slu-openGIS) project, which provides access to data about the St. Louis region as well as software tools for working with local data.
