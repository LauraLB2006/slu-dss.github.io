The SLU Data Science Seminar is the host of [Chris Prener's](https://chris-prener.github.io) [openGIS project](https://github.com/slu-openGIS). The project is a collaborative effort with SLU students to curate and host GIS data about the St. Louis area in an accessible manner. We also maintain several `R` packages that contain tools for working with spatial data. If you are interested in participating in either data curation or `R` software development, please [email Chris](mailto:chris.prener@slu.edu).

## R Packages
