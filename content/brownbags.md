Beginning in Fall 2017, we started hosting single sessions that targeted specific skills. We like the format as an addition to the multi-part seminar series we offer each semester. We are hopting to use it to give SLU faculty, staff, and students the opportunity to showcase the awesome things they are doing with open-source tools (like `R`, Python, or Julia) in their research or teaching. If you have something you'd like to showcase, let us know! Our hope is to host one or two brownbag sessions each semester.
