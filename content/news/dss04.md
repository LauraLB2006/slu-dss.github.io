Our Fall, 2017 seminar series will be a four-part introduction to working with spatial data in `R`. We'll cover the basics of spatial data structures, merging data frames, and using `ggplot2` to create maps. No experience with `R`, GIS work, or mapping is required! Please note that we ask that participants commit to all four seminar dates.

**Where: 3600 Morrissey Hall**

**When: Wednesdays (Sept. 20, Oct. 4, Oct. 18, & Nov. 1) from 2pm to 3pm**
