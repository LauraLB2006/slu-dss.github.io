### Accessible Data Analysis: Using St. Louis Data to Explore Global Issues
In this workshop, we'll use publicly available data about St. Louis to introduce open source data analysis software (`R`) that can be used to explore and respond to questions that are of concern to communities worldwide. Weâ€™ll use two local datasets to introduce participants to the art of data analysis: information on income, and asthma rates, for St. Louis.

Our goal is to showcase how to use basic data science skills to evaluate problems and meet the needs of different communities or organizations. The workshop will be hands-on and will include a brief introduction to the software and local data being used, demonstration of how to import and explore data, and discussion of the different types of analysis that can be performed and the diverse questions that can be addressed in `R`.

**Where: 3600 Morrissey Hall**

**When: Wednesday, April 11th from 12 to 1:45 p.m.**
