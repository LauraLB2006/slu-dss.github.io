title: "DSS Seminar 06: Reproducible Research in R"
best: false
---

The four sessions for the Fall 2018 seminar will cover ways to use `R` for conducting reproducible research. Weâ€™ll discuss:

1. Lesson 1 - September 5th - Introduction to `R` and RStudio
2. Lesson 2 - September 19th - Reading and Writing Data with `readr`, `readxl`, and `haven`
3. Lesson 3 - October 3rd - Notebooks and RMarkdown
4. Lesson 4 - October 17th - Using `knitr`

If you are new to `R`, you are strongly encouraged to commit to all four seminars. Otherwise, feel free to tailor your experience to the skills you wish to develop!

No prior experience with `R` is necessary - in fact, these seminars are tailored to learners with *no* or *little* experience in `R`! The one caveat to this is if you are not planning to attend the first session, we expect you to know how to open an RProject file and navigate your way around the basic elements of RStudio's user interface. Otherwise, there are no assumed skills.

**Where: 3600 Morrissey Hall**
