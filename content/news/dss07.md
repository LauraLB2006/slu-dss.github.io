title: "DSS Seminar 07: Data Wrangling in R"
best: false
---

The four seminar sessions for the Spring 2019 seminar will cover ways to use `R` for data cleaning and wrangling. We'll cover techniques for dealing with messy variable names, removing variables and adding new ones, subsetting observations, and summarizing grouped data using the `R` packages `dplyr` and `janitor`. Weâ€™ll discuss:

1. Lesson 1 - January 23rd - Working with Existing Variables
2. Lesson 2 - February 6th - Creating New Variables
3. Lesson 3 - February 20th - Managing Observations
4. Lesson 4 - March 6th - Grouping and Summarizing Data

No prior experience with `R` is necessary - in fact, these seminars are tailored to learners with *no* or *little* experience in `R`! If you are brand new to `R`, we strongly encourage you to look through our seminar materials that [Introduce R and RStudio](https://github.com/slu-dss/research-01) and cover [RNotebooks](https://github.com/slu-dss/research-03), our tool for teaching.

**Where: 3600 Morrissey Hall**
