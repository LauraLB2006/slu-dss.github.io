Please join us for another installment of our occasional [brownbag series](/brownbags/). Assistant Professor [Cort Rudolph](https://www.slu.edu/arts-and-sciences/psychology/faculty/rudolph-cort.php), from the [Department of Psychology](https://www.slu.edu/arts-and-sciences/psychology/), will be giving a short overview of techniques for producing meta-analyses using `R`. [Meta-analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis) is a statistical technique for evaluating the effects found in multiple scientific studies. No experience with meta-analysis is required. While some basic familiarity with R is helpful, it is also not required.
