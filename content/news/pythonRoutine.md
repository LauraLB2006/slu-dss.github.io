Please join us for another installment of our occasional [brownbag series](/brownbags/). [Srikanth Mudigonda, Ph.D.](https://www.slu.edu/online/contact-us/faculty/srikanth-mudigonda.php), the Director of the [M.S. in Applied Analytics](https://www.slu.edu/programs/graduate/applied-analytics-ms.php), will be giving a short overview of techniques for automating routine data analysis and research tasks using Python. This will be the DSS's first Python related lesson and is being used to help us develop a plan for offering Python content moving forward. If you are interested in using Python for data science, please join us in helping build this community at SLU!
