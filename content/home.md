We are a collaborative, interdisciplinary group at [Saint Louis University](https://www.slu.edu) focused on building researchers' data science skills using open source software. We currently host seminars focused on the programming language `R`. 

The DSS is organized by [Christina Garcia](mailto:christina.garcia@slu.edu), [Kelly Lovejoy](mailto:kelly.lovejoy@slu.edu), and [Chris Prener](mailto:chris.prener@slu.edu).
